# Weather Dashboard

For this assignment, I created the HTML, CSS, and JS from scratch. I created a site that allows a visitor to enter the name of a city and see the current weather and a 5 day forecast for that city. Each new city searched is saved in local storage and is available to click on in the search history sidebar. The data comes from openweathermap.org via their api.

The following image shows the web application:
